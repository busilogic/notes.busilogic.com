This site is system admin notes I keep for myself in org mode format.

They are converted to HTML using org mode.

To convert org mode to HTML files, have emacs org mode version 8

Run on the org file itself:

```
M-x org-html-export-to-html
```

The index file is a site-map reference to the org files

## Hosting
* The html files are hosted on my freebsd server by nginx in a webserver jail
