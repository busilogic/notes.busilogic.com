*** Terminology
    Hue is color (blue, green, red, etc.).
    Chroma is the purity of a color (a high chroma has no added black, white or gray).
    Saturation refers to how strong or weak a color is (high saturation being strong).
    Value refers to how light or dark a color is (light having a high value).
    Tones are created by adding gray to a color, making it duller than the original.
    Shades are created by adding black to a color, making it darker than the original.
    Tints are created by adding white to a color, making it lighter than the original.
