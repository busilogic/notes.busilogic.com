#+TITLE: PGP with Emacs
------

A quick guide to using PGP and Emacs.
GPG is the best open source encryption password.
Emacs package EasyPG makes working with GPG easy.

* Technologies/Packages
- GnuPGP or GPG
- Org Mode
- EasyPG
-------

* GPG
** Install GPG
  Use brew or a package manager to install gpg

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    $ brew install gpg
  #+END_SRC

** Generate a gpg key
  You can accept the defaults
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  gpg --gen-key  
  #+END_SRC


* Emacs
  Emacs version > 24 comes with EasyPG by default

  - At the begining of your file, place this line:
    #+BEGIN_SRC org
    # -*- epa-file-encrypt-to: ("email-address-tied-to-gpg-key-created") -*-
    #+END_SRC

  - Save the file with a .gpg extension

  - On save, you will be asked for a password.
  - Use the same password to unencrypt the file when opening using emacs
  - Verify the file can't be opened in terminal by doing a 
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    cat filename.org.gpg
    #+END_SRC
    - You should see gibberish in the terminal
